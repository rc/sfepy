* **22.05.2013** Version 2013.2 released (automatic testing of term calls (many
  terms fixed w.r.t. corner cases), new elastic contact plane term + example,
  translated low level base functions from Cython to C for reusability,
  improved gallery http://docs.sfepy.org/gallery/gallery, etc.), see
  :ref:`release notes <2013.1-2013.2>`.

* **27.02.2013** Version 2013.1 released (unified use of stationary and

* **21.11.2012** Version 2012.4 released (initial support for hierarchical
  basis on quadrilateral and brick elements, unified C/Cython structures for
  reference mappings, new linear combination boundary condition: edge

  :ref:`release notes <2012.3-2012.4>`.

* **12.09.2012** Version 2012.3 released (several new terms, material
  parameters can be defined per region using region names, base function values
  can be defined per element, support for global options, etc.), see
