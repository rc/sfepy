Development
===========

If you are interested in working with us, let us know using `our mailing
list`_! Then we recommend reading the :ref:`how_to_contribute` section of our
:ref:`developer_guide`.

We are interested in any contribution. There are many ways how you can
contribute, not just code:

- You can report bugs using `our mailing list`_. You can also add a bug
  report (or a comment) into the `issues`_.
- You can contribute interesting examples/tutorials.
- You can blog about how you use SfePy (let us know!).
- You can help with improving our documentation and these pages.
- ...

Additional ideas can be found at `our wiki`_.
