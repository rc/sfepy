   SfePy: Simple Finite Elements in Python
   =======================================

   SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential
   equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 1D, 2D and 3D. It can be
   viewed both as black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package which can be
   used for building custom applications. The word "simple" means that complex
   FEM problems can be coded very easily and rapidly.

   SfePy can use many terms to build the PDEs to be solved, see
   :ref:`term_overview`. SfePy comes also with a number of examples that can
   get you started, check :ref:`sfepy-gallery-examples-index` and
   :doc:`tutorial`. Some more advanced features are discussed in :doc:`primer`.

   SfePy can be used in parallel (work in progress), see
   :ref:`solving_problems_in_parallel`.
   There is also a preliminary support for the isogeometric analysis,
   outlined in :ref:`isogeometric_analysis`.

   The easiest way to install SfePy is to use `Anaconda`_, see
   :ref:`multi_platform_distributions_notes` in
   :ref:`introduction_installation`.

   **License:** :doc:`BSD <license>`

   Applications
   ------------

   Here we list some of the applications SfePy is/was developed for.

   - homogenization of porous media - parallel flows in a deformable porous
     medium
   - acoustic band gaps, homogenization of a strongly heterogenous
     elastic structure: phononic materials
   - acoustic waves in thin perforated layers
   - finite element formulation of Schroedinger equation
   - flow of a two-phase non-Newtonian fluid medium in a general domain - oil
     expression in screw presses/extruders
